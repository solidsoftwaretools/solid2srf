SOLiD2SRF CONVERSION TOOL

This software takes SOLiD data as input and creates an SRF file.

BUILDING

At the console type
1) ./configure
2) make

Programs built are
SRF/writer/SRF_WriteGenSOLiD
SRF/reader/SRF_Reader
SRF/reader/SRF_ZtrReader

APPLICATIONS

SRF_Reader <output file> - dumps the contents of the SRF file. It does not dump the contents of the ZTR chunks.
SRF_ZtrReader <output file> - dumps the contents of the SRF file. It also dumps the contents of the ZTR chunks.

SRF_WriteGenSOLiD –cf <cfasta file> -o <output file> -t <title> 
-q <quality file> -i <intensity file root> -x <xml file> 
-cf2 <second cfasta file> -q2 <second quality file> -i2 <second intensity file root> 
-noABprefix –noPrimerBaseInREGN  -to

Mandatory Arguments:
 -cf <cfasta file> 		: specifies the cfasta file. This is the first of two such files for a paired end dataset. 
-o <output file> 		: the output file. If the file already exists, it is overwritten. 
-t <title> 		: used to as a prefix to the read id. If the title is specified in the comment lines of the 
cfasta file, the two must match unless the –to argument is specified. Note: if the title is not specified in the file, the –
to argument becomes mandatory as well. 
Additional data files (any combination permitted): 
-q <quality file>  		: specifies the quality file. This is the first of two such files for a paired end dataset. 
-i <intensity file root> 	: Base name of the intensity files. The application appends [CY3|CY5|TXR|FTC].fasta to 
find the four intensity files. This is the first of two such sets of files for a paired end dataset. 
-x <xml file>  		: specifies an XML file for inclusion in the SRF XML block. The file contents are copied 
verbatim. 
Second set of data files to support paired end datasets. The combination must match those of the first set e.g. if a 
quality file is given for the first set, it must also be provided for the second:
-cf2 <cfasta file>  
-q2 <quality file> 
-i2 <intensity file root> 
Additional switches: 
-noABprefix		: This switch removes the VAB_ prefix to the read id. Note: use of this switch may render 
the resulting file in violation of the SRF specification.  
-noPrimerBaseInREGN	: By default, the last base of the primer is added to the REGN field for ~5-6% saving in file 
size. If this switch is specified, the last base of the primer is prepended to the sequence. This base is given a quality 
of 255 and an intensity of -1.0. 
-to			: Title override. The title specified in the –t argument does not have to match the title 
specified in the data files when this switch is set.
